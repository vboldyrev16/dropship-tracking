# Get Correct Supabase Connection Strings

The password might be incorrect or we need the exact connection strings from Supabase.

## Method 1: From Supabase Dashboard (EASIEST)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ddsnpssvrlgmuitiisjt/settings/database

2. Look for **"Connection string"** section (should be on that page, scroll down)

3. You should see dropdown or tabs. Select **"URI"**

4. There will be TWO connection strings shown:

   **Connection pooling (Session mode):**
   - Copy the ENTIRE string
   - It will have `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in it
   - Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with: `Djdf16041998`
   - Send me the FULL string

   **Direct connection:**
   - Copy the ENTIRE string  
   - It will have `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in it
   - Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with: `Djdf16041998`
   - Send me the FULL string

## Method 2: Double-Check Password

The password `Djdf16041998` - is this 100% correct?

If not sure:
1. Go to Database settings
2. Click "Reset database password"
3. Copy the NEW password they give you
4. Send me the new password

## Method 3: Check Project Settings API page

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ddsnpssvrlgmuitiisjt/settings/api
2. Scroll to "Connection Pooling" section
3. You should see connection strings there
4. Copy both and send them to me

---

**Please send me:**
1. The EXACT connection pooling string (with password filled in)
2. The EXACT direct connection string (with password filled in)

OR

Tell me if you want to reset the password and get a new one.
